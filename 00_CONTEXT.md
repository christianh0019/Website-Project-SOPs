# Mission Context: The "Performance-First" Website Framework

**To:** All Developers & Agents
**Subject:** The Standards for New Website Creation

## The Goal
We are not just "building websites." We are deploying **high-performance revenue engines** for custom home builders and remodelers.
Every site we ship must be better than 99% of competitors in three specific areas:
1.  **Search Visibility**: It must dominate local SEO for high-value keywords (e.g., "Custom Home Builder in [City]").
2.  **User Experience**: It must feel premium, fast, and frictionless.
3.  **Conversion**: It must psychologically guide the user from "curiosity" to "consultation."

## The Core Philosophy: "Entity-Service-Location"
Our framework is built on a specific data structure. We do not write generic content. Everything is grounded in the **Triad**:
-   **Who** (The Entity): The builder, their history, their "Operational Maturity" (fixed-price, warranty, process).
-   **What** (The Service): Specific high-ticket offers (New Construction, Basement Finishing, Pop-Tops).
-   **Where** (The Location): Hyper-local specifics (soil types, zoning codes, tap fees, neighborhoods).

## The "Homestead" Standard
The **Foundation Codebase** (`Website-Project-SOPs/Foundation_Codebase`) is your source of truth. It is the structural skeleton derived from the Homestead reference.
When creating a new site, you must strictly adhere to its patterns:

### 1. The Structure
-   **Service Pages**: Must follow the "Problem-Agitation-Solution" (PAS) narrative.
-   **Location Pages**: Must include "Local Vectors" (specific regulations, geography, costs).
-   **Portfolio**: Must follow the "Hero's Journey" case study format.

### 2. The Tech Stack
-   **Framework**: Vite + React + TypeScript
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (pixel-perfect aesthetics)
-   **SEO**: `react-helmet-async` with comprehensive Schema.org JSON-LD.
-   **Speed**: Mobile-first, sub-second load times.

## How to Use These SOPs
This folder contains the **Standard Operating Procedures** (SOPs) for every page type.
Before writing a single line of code for a new page, **READ THE SOP**.
-   Building a Service Page? → Read `01_SOP_SERVICE_PAGE.md`
-   Building a Location Page? → Read `02_SOP_LOCATION_PAGE.md`
-   Optimizing SEO? → Read `05_SOP_SEO_STRATEGY.md`

**Do not guess. Follow the blueprint.**
