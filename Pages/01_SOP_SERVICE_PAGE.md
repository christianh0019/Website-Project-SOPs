# SOP: Creating a High-Performance Service Page

**ID:** SOP-01
**Type:** Service Page (e.g., New Construction, Remodeling, Basements)
**Reference Implementation:** `src/pages/services/NewConstruction.tsx`

## 1. The Strategy: "The Expert's Argument"
A service page must do more than list features. It must articulate a **Sales Argument** that connects a specific customer pain to our unique solution.
**Core Objective**: Move the user from "I have a problem" (e.g., need more space, outdated kitchen) to "This company is the safest choice to solve it."

### The "Triad" Data Structure
Every service page must be grounded in three vectors:
1.  **Entity**: Who is doing the work? (Expertise/Operational Maturity)
2.  **Service**: What is the specific offer? (Deep vertical integration)
3.  **Location**: Where is it happening? (Local nuance/regulation)

## 2. Structural Blueprint (The "Must-Haves")

### Section 1: The Promise (Hero)
**Purpose**: confirm relevance instantly.
-   **Headline Constraint**: Formula = `[Specific Service] + [Primary Markets] + [Value Prop]`.
    -   *Bad*: "Building Dreams."
    -   *Good*: "Custom Home Builders in Loveland & Fort Collins | Sustainable Design-Build."
-   **Sub-headline**: The "Hook" - Address the primary desire (e.g., Legacy, ROI, Lifestyle).
-   **CTAs**:
    -   *Primary*: "Feasibility Study" (Consultation).
    -   *Secondary*: "Download Cost Guide" (Lead Magnet for price-shoppers).

### Section 2: The Empathy Layer (PAS Framework)
**Purpose**: To show we understand the *risks* of the project better than the client does.
-   **Problem**: State the hidden friction (e.g., "Building is stressful," "Contractors ghost you").
-   **Agitation**: Twist the knife with specific pain points (e.g., "Expensive tap fees," "Zoning variance nightmares," "Surprise change orders").
-   **Solution**: Present our process as the engineered antidote to this chaos.

### Section 3: The Competence Layer (Clustered Features)
**Purpose**: To prove "Operational Maturity." Do not just list "Quality."
-   **Strategy**: Cluster your features into 3 "pillars" of competence:
    1.  **Technical**: Hard skills (Engineering, Soil Analysis, Energy Codes).
    2.  **Financial**: Money safety (Fixed-Price Contracts, Lien Waivers, Transparent Draws).
    3.  **Regulatory**: Legal safety (Permits, HOA navigation, Inspections).
-   *Why?* This proves we are a professional business, not just "a guy with a truck."

### Section 4: The Evidence Layer (Social Proof)
**Purpose**: Validation from peers.
-   **Constraint**: Testimonials *must* match the service. Do not show a "Remodel" review on a "New Build" page.
-   **Visuals**: Show completed projects in the *same category*.

### Section 5: The System Layer (Process)
**Purpose**: To answer "What happens next?"
-   **Strategy**: Visualize the timeline.
-   **Goal**: Reduce the fear of the unknown. A clear roadmap = a confident buyer.

### Section 6: The Data Layer (FAQ)
**Purpose**: To rank for long-tail queries and "People Also Ask."
-   **Strategy**: "Answer First."
-   **Content**: Tackle the hard questions head-on.
    -   "What is the cost per sq ft?" (Give a range, don't say "it depends").
    -   "How long does it take?"
    -   "Do you handle permits?"

### Section 7: Soft Conversion (Lead Magnet)
**Purpose**: Capture the 90% of visitors who aren't ready to buy today.
-   **Offer**: A "Cost Guide" or "Planning Checklist".
-   **Exchange**: Email for value.
