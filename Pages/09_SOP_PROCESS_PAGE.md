# SOP: Creating the Process Page

**ID:** SOP-09
**Type:** Core Page
**Reference Implementation:** `src/pages/Process.tsx`

## 1. The Strategy: "The Roadmap to Certainty"
Construction is scary. Clients fear budget overruns, endless delays, and ghosting.
**Core Objective**: Remove the fear.
**The Insight**: A clear, detailed process implies control. If we have a plan, their money is safe.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Adapting for Clients**: Not every builder uses the exact same steps. This SOP defines the *Logical Flow* (Pre -> Build -> Post), but the specific step names and counts (e.g., 3 steps vs. 7 steps) should be adjusted to match the client's actual workflow.

## 2. Structural Blueprint

### Section 1: The Philosophy Hero
**Purpose**: Set the expectation of order.
-   **Headline**: "How We Build" or "The [Company Name] Standard."
-   **Subtitle**: A promise of communication (e.g., "No jargon. No black boxes.").

### Section 2: The Timeline (The Steps)
**Purpose**: Visual proof of organization.
-   **Layout**: Alternating Zig-Zag layout (Image Left / Text Right -> Image Right / Text Left).
-   **Visuals**: Use *real* photos corresponding to the phase.
    -   *Design Phase*: Show blueprints/renderings.
    -   *Build Phase*: Show framing/excavation.

#### Required Phases (Adjust names as needed)
1.  **Discovery/Feasibility**: The "Can we do this?" phase.
    *   *Micro-CTA*: "Book Discovery Call" link.
2.  **Pre-Construction/Design**: The "Paper" phase. Emphasize permits and fixed-price contracts.
3.  **Construction**: The "Dirt" phase. Emphasize weekly updates/communication apps (e.g., CoConstruct).
4.  **Delivery/Warranty**: The "Forever" phase. Emphasize the 1-year/10-year warranty.

### Section 3: The "CTA Injection" Strategy
**Purpose**: Catch the user at their specific point of interest.
**Requirement**: The reference template was missing these. **You MUST add them.**
-   **Strategy**: After key phases, offer a relevant "Next Step."
    -   *After Pre-Construction*: "See our Design Process" (Link to Blog/Article).
    -   *After Delivery*: "Download Warranty Guide" (Lead Magnet) or "View Finished Homes" (Portfolio).

### Section 4: The Final Gate (Bottom CTA)
**Purpose**: The ultimate filter.
-   **Headline**: "Ready to start Phase 1?"
-   **Offer**: Make Phase 1 feel low-risk (e.g., "The Discovery Call is complimentary").

## Checklist
- [ ] Steps follow a logical chronological order.
-   [ ] Every step has a visual anchor (Icon + Photo).
-   [ ] "Fixed-Price" and "Warranty" are explicitly mentioned keywords.
-   [ ] **CRITICAL**: At least 2 intermediate CTAs are injected between steps or sections to guide passive readers.
