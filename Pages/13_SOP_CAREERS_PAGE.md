# SOP: Creating the Careers Page

**ID:** SOP-13
**Type:** Recruiting Page
**Reference Implementation:** `src/pages/Careers.tsx`

## 1. The Strategy: "The Talent Magnet"
In a labor-short market, we are selling the *job* as much as we sell a house.
**Core Objective**: Attract "A-Players" who value stability and craft.
**The Insight**: Good tradespeople are tired of disorganized builders, late payments, and unsafe sites. We market *against* those pain points.

## 2. Structural Blueprint

### Section 1: The Culture Pitch (Employer Branding)
**Purpose**: To weed out those just looking for a paycheck.
-   **Headline**: "Build Your Legacy" (or similar aspirational hook).
-   **Values Grid**:
    -   *Safety*: "Stop Work Authority."
    -   *Craft*: "No cutting corners."
    -   *Respect*: "No weekend work" (or whatever the real policy is).

### Section 2: The Job Board
**Purpose**: Clear requirements.
-   **Structure**: List open roles with specific "Locations" and "Type" (Full-time vs. Contract).
-   **Descriptions**: Focus on *responsibilities* and *standards*, not generic fluff.

### Section 3: The Application (High-Friction)
**Purpose**: To filter for serious candidates.
-   **Form Fields**:
    -   Position Applied For.
    -   Years of Experience (Numeric).
    -   Resume Paste/Upload.
-   **Strategy**: Do not hide this behind a generic "Email us" link. Make it easy to apply *now*.

## Checklist
- [ ] Safety/Culture is emphasized *before* the job listings.
-   [ ] Job descriptions specify location/territory.
-   [ ] There is a dedicated form for applications (not shared with Sales).
