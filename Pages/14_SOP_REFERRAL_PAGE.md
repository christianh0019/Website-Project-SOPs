# SOP: Creating the Referral Program Page

**ID:** SOP-14
**Type:** Loop / Growth
**Reference Implementation:** (New Page)

## 1. The Strategy: "The Advocate's Reward"
Satisfied clients are the highest-quality lead source.
**Core Objective**: Activate the network.
**The Insight**: People *want* to refer good work, but they need a specific trigger (incentive) and a frictionless mechanism to do so. The reward is a "Thank You," not a bribe.

## 2. Structural Blueprint

### Section 1: The Hook (The Concept)
**Purpose**: Validate their experience.
-   **Headline**: "Share the [Company Name] Standard."
-   **Sub-headline**: "You love your new home. Your friends will too."

### Section 2: The Incentive (The "Why")
**Purpose**: Tangible value.
-   **Structure**: Clear "Give & Get" or Direct Reward.
-   **Options** (Select one strategy per client):
    -   *Cash*: "$2,000 Referral Bonus."
    -   *Upgrade*: "Free Outdoor Kitchen Design Upgrade for your friend."
    -   *Charity*: "We donate $1,000 to your favorite local charity."
-   **Constraint**: Terms must be simple. "Paid upon project completion" (or "Upon Contract Signing" depending on builder preference, but usually Completion for larger payouts).

### Section 3: The Mechanism (The How)
**Purpose**: Frictionless handoff.
-   **The Process**:
    1.  Fill out the form (Your Info + Their Info).
    2.  We reach out (White Glove service).
    3.  If they build, you get paid.

### Section 4: The Form
**Purpose**: Capture the lead + the source.
-   **Fields**:
    -   Referrer Name (Current Client).
    -   Referral Name (Friend).
    -   Referral Contact Info.
    -   "Project Type" (New Build / Remodel).

## Checklist
- [ ] Incentive is concrete (Dollar amount or specific item), not vague.
-   [ ] Terms of payout are explicitly stated (e.g., "Upon Project Completion").
-   [ ] Form clearly separates "Your Info" from "Friend's Info."
