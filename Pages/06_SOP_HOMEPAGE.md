# SOP: Creating the Homepage

**ID:** SOP-06
**Type:** Landing Page
**Reference Implementation:** `src/pages/Home.tsx`

## 1. The Strategy: "The Trust Ladder"
The homepage is a psychological ladder that guides the user from "Unknown" to "Trust".
It is not a static brochure. It is a filter that segments traffic and establishes immediate authority.

**Core Objective**: Within 5 seconds, the user must know:
1.  **Who** we are (The Entity).
2.  **Where** we work (The Location).
3.  **What** we do (The Service).

## 2. Structural Blueprint (The "Must-Haves")

### Section 1: The Authority Hero
**Purpose**: Immediate positioning and segmentation.
-   **Headline Constraint**: MUST include the **Primary Keyword** and **Primary Location** (e.g., "Custom Builder in [City]"). Do not use abstract slogans like "Dream Big" as the H1.
-   **Sub-headline**: The emotional hook or value proposition.
-   **CTAs**:
    -   *Primary (Hard)*: "Start Project" / "Consultation".
    -   *Secondary (Soft)*: "View Work" / "Learn More".

### Section 2: Service Segmentation
**Purpose**: Rapidly direct users to their specific need (New Build vs. Remodel).
-   **Strategy**: "Clarity over Creativity." Do not hide services behind obscure names.
-   **Requirement**: Distinct entry points for the core revenue streams.
-   **Interaction**: Users should be able to identify which bucket they fall into without scrolling more than 20% of the page.

### Section 3: The "Anxiety Reduction" Layer (Process)
**Purpose**: To demystify the complex construction process.
-   **Strategy**: Show, don't just tell. Use a timeline, steps, or a clear "How We Work" summary.
-   **Goal**: Prove that we have a system, which implies we are organized and safe.

### Section 4: Visual Proof (Portfolio)
**Purpose**: Create desire.
-   **Strategy**: High-quality visuals are non-negotiable. Only show the *best* work detailed in the Portfolio SOP.
-   **Context**: Don't just show images; imply successful outcomes (family happiness, luxury living).

### Section 5: The "Safe Bet" Signals (Trust/Heritage)
**Purpose**: Prove longevity and financial stability.
-   **Content Requirements**:
    -   **Years in Business**: Explicitly state experience level.
    -   **Local Roots**: Mention specific ties to the community.
    -   **Social Proof**: Real testimonials with identifying details (Names/Locations).

### Section 6: Local SEO Data Layer (FAQ)
**Purpose**: To rank for "Answer Box" queries and long-tail location keywords.
-   **Strategy**: "Answer First."
-   **Content**: Address cost, timeline, and specific local feasibility questions directy on the homepage. This signals to Google that this page is a resource, not just a flyer.

### Section 7: Final Conversion Point
**Purpose**: Catch the user after they have climbed the "Trust Ladder."
-   **Strategy**: Strong contrast. Direct instruction.
-   **Constraint**: Must offer a clear next step (Call, Form, or Email).
