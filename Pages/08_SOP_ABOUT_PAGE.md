# SOP: Creating the About Page

**ID:** SOP-08
**Type:** Core Page
**Reference Implementation:** `src/pages/About.tsx`

## 1. The Strategy: "The Man Behind the Brand"
In high-ticket construction (+$1M builds), the client is not buying a product; they are entering a marriage with the builder.
**Core Objective**: De-risk the relationship.
**The Insight**: People trust *people*, not logos. The About page must kill the "Faceless Corporation" vibe immediately.

## 2. Structural Blueprint (The "Must-Haves")

### Section 1: The Founder's Letter (The Pledge)
**Purpose**: Direct, personal assurance of integrity.
-   **Visual**: High-quality photo of the Founder (not a stock photo of a handshake).
-   **Content**: A signed letter.
    -   *Constraint*: Must mention the company's origin date (e.g., "Since 1990").
    -   *Key Phrase*: "Radical Transparency" or equivalent promise of financial honesty.
-   **Signature**: Use a digital signature image to authenticate the message.

### Section 2: Values That Cost Money (The Philosophy)
**Purpose**: To prove we don't cut corners.
-   **Strategy**: Values shouldn't be generic ("Honesty"). They should imply a cost we willingly pay.
    -   *Weak*: "Quality."
    -   *Strong*: "Quality First: We don't optimize for speed; we optimize for longevity."
-   **Layout**: 3-4 card grid with icons.

### Section 3: The Journey (The Timeline)
**Purpose**: To prove we aren't a "fly-by-night" operation.
-   **Strategy**: Visualize stability.
-   **Milestones to Include**:
    -   founding Year.
    -   Key Awards.
    -   Generational hand-offs (e.g., "Daughter joins firm").
-   *Why?* A 30-year timeline implies we will still be here in 1 year to honor the warranty.

### Section 4: The Leadership Team (The Faces)
**Purpose**: "Who will be in my house?"
-   **Visuals**: Professional headshots. Same lighting, same background.
-   **Roles**: Define who handles what.
    -   "Lead Architect" (Design).
    -   "Head of Construction" (Execution).
-   **CTA**: "Join Our Team" (Subtle recruiting signal).

## Checklist

-   [ ] Timeline includes at least 3 historical milestones.
